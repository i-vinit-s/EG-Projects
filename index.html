                <h3>Personal life</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In February 1995, Khan married writer and fellow NSD graduate Sutapa Sikdar. They had two

                        in
                        his name. He later dropped Khan from his name because—according to a 2016 interview—he wanted
                        his
                        work to define him, not his lineage</li>
